Muito se fala sobre como a sexualidade feminina era reprimida até pouco tempo atrás e sobre como isso ecoa até hoje.

Uma das minhas passagens preferidas para exemplificar isso é de um texto sobre sexualidade de [William Acton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Acton_(doctor)), um respeitado médico da era vitoriana. Um trecho do texto que às vezes é citado é o se traduz mais ou menos assim:

> Devo dizer que a maioria das mulheres (felizmente para a sociedade) não padece muito de sensações sexuais de qualquer espécie. Aquilo que é habitual para os homens, para as mulheres é apenas excepcional.

Sempre achei uma forma concisa de mostrar o quão problemática era a visão sobre o tesão feminino até "ontem", especialmente os parênteses que o autor escolheu fazer. Só que sempre esquecia o nome do autor e do livro. Vou colocar nesse post para ficar mais fácil de encontrar no futuro.

O nome do livro é *The functions and disorders of the reproductive organs in childhood, youth, adult age, and advanced life: considered in their physiological, social, and moral relations* e está [disponível no Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/functionsdisorde00actorich/page/212/mode/1up).

Abaixo listo o conteúdo das páginas 212 e 213:

> —We have already mentioned lack of sexual feeling in the female as not an uncommon cause of apparent or temporary impotence in the male. There is so much ignorance on the subject, and so many false ideas are current as to women's sexual condition, and are so productive of mischief, that I need offer no apology for giving here a plain statement that most medical men will corroborate.

> I have taken pains to obtain and compare abundant evidence on this subject, and the result of my inquiries I may briefly epitomise as follows:**—I should say that the majority of women (happily for society) are not very much troubled with sexual feeling of any kind. What men are habitually, women are only exceptionally.** It is too true, I admit, as the Divorce Court shows, that there are some few women who have sexual desires so strong that they surpass those of men, and shock public feeling by their consequences. I admit, of course, the existence of sexual excitement terminating even in nymphomania, a form of insanity that those accustomed to visit lunatic asylums must be fully conversant with; but, with these sad exceptions, there can be no doubt that sexual feeling in the female is in the majority of cases in abeyance, and that it requires positive and considerable excitement to be roused to all; and even if roused (which in many instances it never can be) it is very moderate compared with that of the male. Many persons, and particularly young men, form their ideas of women's sensuous feeling from what they notice early in life among loose or, at least, low and immoral women. There is always a certain number of females who, though not ostensibly in the ranks of prostitutes, make a kind of a trade of a pretty face. They are fond of admiration, they like to attract the attention of those immediately above them. Any susceptible boy is easily led to believe, whether he is altogether overcome by the syren or not, that she, and therefore all women, must have at least as strong passions as himself. Such women, however, give a very false idea of the condition of female sexual feeling in general. Association with the loose women of the London streets in casinos and other immoral haunts (who, if they have not sexual feeling, counterfeit it so well that the novice does not suspect but that it is genuine), seems to corroborate such an impression, and as I have stated above, it is from these erroneous notions that so many unmarried men imagine that the marital duties they will have to undertake are beyond their exhausted strength, and from this reason dread and avoid marriage.

> Married men — medical men — or married women themselves, would, if appealed to, tell a very different tale, and vindicate female nature from the vile aspersions cast on it by the abandoned conduct and ungoverned lusts of a few of its worst examples.

> I am ready to maintain that there are many females who never feel any sexual excitement whatever. Others, again, immediately after each period, do become, to a limited degree, capable of experiencing it; but this capacity is often temporary, and may entirely cease till the next menstrual period. Many of the best mothers, wives, and managers of households, know little of or are careless about sexual indulgences. Love of home, of children, and of domestic duties are the only passions they feel.

> As a general rule, a modest woman seldom desires any sexual gratification for herself. She submits to her husband's embraces, but principally to gratify him; and, were it not for the desire of maternity, would far rather be relieved from his attentions. No nervous or feeble young man need, therefore, be deterred from marriage by any exaggerated notion of the ardous duties required from him. Let him be well assured, on my authority backed by the opinion of many, that the married woman has no wish to be placed on the footing of a mistress.
